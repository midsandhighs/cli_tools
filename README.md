#cli tools

##CONTENTS 

###.vimrc  
My vim customization file, including Vundles. Verifed working on Debian Wheezy, OS X 10.9, 10.10, and 10,11, FreeBSD 10.1 Release  

####Vundles
* vim-plist: for plsit files
* vim-ragtag: for web files
* vim-markdown: for markdown files
* vim-fugitive: Git status in vim  

###.bash_profile:###   
placeholder for a bash profile, but it seems to be too subjective per machine. keeping it here until I decide what to do with it. Currently for OS X machines. Not even going to go there regarding .bashrc files and whether or not I need to get a tcsh thing going   

###cli.sh:###   
a dumb script to install my .vimrc and pull Vundles on any BSD system.  

###irc.sh:###   
a dumber script that I hope I can turn into a really simply way to launch my IRSSI screen regardless of whether the screen is attached or detached.  

More later.
