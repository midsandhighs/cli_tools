#WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE#

There are fun and games here.

##Contains:##

*.vimrc*: My vim customization file, including Vundles

*.bash_profile*: placeholder for a bash profile, but it seems to be too subjective per machine. 
keeping it here until I decide what to do with it.

*cli.sh*: a dumb script to install my .vimrc and pull Vundles on any BSD system.

More later.
